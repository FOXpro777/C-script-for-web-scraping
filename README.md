# C-script-for-web-scraping
This script uses the python-telegram-bot library to create a Telegram bot that can copy messages from any chat to a target chat. You'll need to replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your own bot token and TARGET_CHAT_ID_HERE with the ID of the chat where you want to copy the messages.

To use this script, you can add it to a server or run it locally on your computer. When the script is running, any message sent to any chat that the bot is a member of will be copied to the target chat.

The topic of this script is automating the process of copying messages in Telegram, which can be useful for archiving important messages or for sharing them across multiple chats.
